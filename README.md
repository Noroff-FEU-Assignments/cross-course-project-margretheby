# Cross Course Project - Rainydays

<img src="https://github.com/Noroff-FEU-Assignments/cross-course-project-margretheby/blob/main/rainydays-screen.jpg" alt="Screenshot of the Rainydays website on desktop">
This website is a project I have been working on during the frontend course at Noroff School of techonology and digital media. This is the first website I designed and coded, and it has gradually improved due to the progression of the course. 

## Description
For this assignment I chose the brief about a company called Rainydays, which sell rain coats. Their tagline is "Pushing the comfort zone", and apart from that I was free to chose everything from design, to images and copy.
